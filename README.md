I am a Neurobiology PhD Student and currently developing mathematical and computational models of neuronal cell biology - using mean field modeling of systems of partial differential equations and stochastic modeling. By training I am an experimental Neurobiologist with more than 16 years of experience in programming and a keen interest in computational neuroscience and machine learning.
