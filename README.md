I am working in computational neuroscience in the group of Tatjana Tchumatchenko and currently developing mathematical models of neuronal cell biology underlying synaptic plasticity.

For my PhD I worked in the group of Frank Bradke on microtubule dynamics during neurodevelopment.

I have more than 16 years of experience in programming and 8 years of experience in live-cell imaging of neurons.
